Anti Tor
========

Tor is a great tool, but the anonymity it offers also attracts a lot of bad people. Using this plugin you will be able to fully detect &amp; restrict any Tor activity on your website.

### Features
 
* Detect & restrict any Tor activity on your website
* Easy off on switch
* Show the number of blocked attempts

#### How it works?
Anti Tor is frequently pulling a list with all the `Tor nodes` IP addresses, with this information it can
construct a good black list for Tor users.
(The plugin send requests to my server http://localhoster.org every half an hour, in order update your site black list.)
