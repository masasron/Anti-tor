== Description ==

Tor is a great tool, but the anonymity it offers also attracts a lot of bad people.
Using this plugin you will be able to fully detect & restrict any Tor activity on your website.

Features
 
1. Detect & restrict any Tor activity on your website
1. Easy off on switch
1. Show the number of blocked attempts

How it works?
Anti Tor is frequently pulling a list with all the `Tor nodes` IP addresses, with this information it can
construct a good black list for Tor users.
(The plugin send requests to my server http://localhoster.org every half an hour, in order update your site black list.)

== Installation ==

1. Upload `antitor` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Click on the `Anti Tor` menu item
4. Check the `Block access for Tor users`
